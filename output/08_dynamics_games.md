## Model

### Intro

Setting: agents making **strategic decisions** in **dynamic
environments**.

-   Entry and exit: Collard-Wexler ([2013](#ref-collard2013demand))
-   Sunk costs: Ryan ([2012](#ref-ryan2012costs))
-   Innovation: Igami ([2017](#ref-igami2017estimating))
    -   (or whatever changes in response to investment)
-   Learning-by-doing
-   Switching costs
-   Stockpiling: Hendel and Nevo ([2006](#ref-hendel2006measuring))

### Simple Example

Lousely taken from Ericson and Pakes ([1995](#ref-ericson1995markov))

-   Builds on Maskin and Tirole ([1988](#ref-maskin1988theory)), Maskin
    and Tirole ([1988](#ref-maskin1988theory)), Maskin and Tirole
    ([1987](#ref-maskin1987theory))

-   Firms invest to increase the future quality of their product

-   State $s_{it}$: quality of product $i$ in period $t$

-   Per period profits $$
    \pi ( s_{it}, s_{-it}, ; \theta^\pi)
    $$ where

    -   $s_{-it}$: state vector of all other firms in period $t$
    -   $\theta^\pi$: parameters that govern static profits

-   We can micro-fund profits with some demand and supply functions

### Dynamic Decisions

In each period firms have 3 choices (in order)

1.  If entrant, $e_{it}$: whether to enter the market or not

2.  If incumbent, $d_{it}$: whether to exit the market or not

3.  If incumbent, $a_{it}$: investment

    -   Influences your state transition probability $f$ $$
        s_{i, t+1} = f(s_{it}, a_{it}, \epsilon_{it} ; \theta^f)
        $$ where

        -   $\epsilon_{it}$: shock that is not known to the firm when
            making the decision
            -   it does not need to be there
        -   $\theta^f$: parameters that govern state transitions

    -   Example of transition $$
        s_{i, t+1} = \delta s_{it} + a_{it} + \epsilon_{it}
        $$ I.e. depreciation of capital + investment and noise

### Value Function

Belman Equation incumbent $i$ at time $t$ $$
\begin{aligned}
V (s_{i t}, s_{-i t} ; \theta) = & \pi(s_{i t}, s_{-i t} ; \theta^{\pi}) + \max_{d_{i} \in \lbrace 0,1 \rbrace} 
\Bigg\lbrace
\begin{array}{c}
\beta \phi \ ; \newline
\max _{a_{i t} \geq 0} \Big\lbrace - a_{i t} + \beta \mathbb E \Big[V (s_{i, t+1}, s_{-i, t+1} \ ; \ \theta) \Big| s_{i t}, s_{-i t}, a_{i t} \Big] \Big\rbrace 
\end{array}
\Bigg\rbrace
\end{aligned}
$$ where

-   $\beta \in (0,1)$: discount factor
-   $\phi$: exit scrap value
-   $a_{it} \in \mathbb R_+$: investment decision, in dollars
-   $d_{it} \in \lbrace 0,1 \rbrace$: exit decision
-   The expectation $\mathbb E$ is over
    -   The shocks $\epsilon_{it}$
    -   Rivals future states $s_{-i,t+1}$

### Entry

We can also incorporate endogenous entry.

-   One or more **potential entrants** exist outside the market
-   They can pay an entry cost $\kappa$ and enter the market at a
    quality state $\bar s$

Value function $$
V^{\text {e}} (s_{i t}, s_{-i t} ; \theta) = \max_{e \in \lbrace 0,1 \rbrace }
\Bigg\lbrace
\begin{array}{c}
0 \ ; \newline
-\kappa + \beta \mathbb E \Big[ V(\bar s, s_{-i, t+1} ; \theta) \Big| s_{t} \Big]
\end{array}
\Bigg\rbrace
$$ where

-   $e \in \lbrace 0,1 \rbrace$: entry decision
-   $\kappa$: entry cost

Do we observe potential entrants?

-   Igami ([2017](#ref-igami2017estimating)): tech industry announce
    their entry
-   Critique: not really potential entrants, they are half-way inside

### Equilibrium

Equillibrium notion: **Markow Perfect Equilibrium** ([Maskin and Tirole
1988](#ref-maskin1988theory))

-   A set value, policy functions and transition probabilities $$
    \Big \lbrace \ V(\cdot), \ V^{e n t}(\cdot), \ d(\cdot), \ a(\cdot), \ e(\cdot), \ f(s_{-i, t+1} | s_{t}) \ \Big \rbrace
    $$ such that

    1.  $V(\cdot), \ V^{e n t}(\cdot), \ d(\cdot), \ a(\cdot), \ e(\cdot)$
        solve their respective equations *given*
        $f(s_{-i, t+1} | s_{t})$
    2.  the transition probabilities $f(s_{-i, t+1} | s_{t})$ are
        generated by the strategies $d(\cdot), \ a(\cdot), \ e(\cdot)$

What is it basically?

-   Nash Equilibrium in the policy functions
-   What are we ruling out?
    -   Strategies that depend on longer histories
    -   E.g. “has anyone ever cheated in a cartel?”

### Solving the model

Numerically!

1.  Given parameter values $\theta$
2.  Start with a guess for the value and policy functions
3.  They will imply some transition probabilities
4.  That will imply some new policies and so on…
5.  … until what?

**Issues**

-   No guarantee of convergence
    -   Doraszelski and Satterthwaite
        ([2010](#ref-doraszelski2010computable)): prove existence of MPE
        with random costs/scrap values
    -   The BR iteration can never find mixed-strategy equilibria
-   Multiple equilibria issues
-   Curse of dimensionality (computational issue, not conceptual)

### Multiple Equilibria

-   Besanko et al. ([2010](#ref-besanko2010learning)) and Borkovsky,
    Doraszelski, and Kryukov ([2010](#ref-borkovsky2010user)): homotopy
    method
    -   can find some equilibria
    -   not all
    -   complicated to implement
-   Iskhakov et al. ([2017](#ref-iskhakov2017endogenous)): grid method
    -   can find all equilibria
    -   but for very specific class of dynamic games
    -   must always proceed “forward”
        -   e.g. either entry or exit but not both
-   Pesendorfer and Schmidt-Dengler
    ([2010](#ref-pesendorfer2010sequential)): the BR iteration cannot
    find all possible equilibria, because some equilibria are not
    Lyapunov-stable, which means you cannot find one unless you start
    your numerical search from the exact solution
-   Su and Judd ([2012](#ref-su2012constrained)) and Egesdal, Lai, and
    Su ([2015](#ref-egesdal2015estimating)): show this point
    numerically, by using their proposed Mathematical Programming with
    Equilibrium Constraints (MPEC) approach

### Curse of Dimensionality

Two potential solutions:

1.  **Computational**: approximate the equilibrium
    -   Doraszelski and Judd ([2019](#ref-doraszelski2019dynamic)):
        games with random moves
    -   Farias, Saure, and Weintraub
        ([2012](#ref-farias2012approximate)): solve the global problem
        approximately
2.  **Conceptual**: define another game
    -   Weintraub, Benkard, and Van Roy
        ([2008](#ref-weintraub2008markov)): oblivious equilibrium
    -   Pakes and McGuire ([2001](#ref-pakes2001stochastic)) and
        Fershtman and Pakes ([2012](#ref-fershtman2012dynamic)):
        experience-based equilibrium
    -   Doraszelski and Judd ([2012](#ref-doraszelski2012avoiding)):
        games in continuous time

## Estimation - Bajari, Benkard, Levin (2008)

### Methods

We want to estimate 3 sets of **parameters**:

-   $\theta^\pi$: parameterizes period profit function $\pi()$
-   $\theta^f$: parameterizes state transition function $f()$
-   $\theta^{ddc}$: scrap value $\phi$ and entry cost $\kappa$

Generally 2 **approaches**

1.  Full solution
    -   Impractical
2.  Hotz and Miller ([1993](#ref-hotz1993conditional)) CCP inversion
    -   Aguirregabiria and Mira
        ([2007](#ref-aguirregabiria2007sequential))
    -   Bajari, Benkard, and Levin ([2007](#ref-bajari2007estimating))
    -   Pakes, Ostrovsky, and Berry ([2007](#ref-pakes2007simple))
    -   Pesendorfer and Schmidt-Dengler
        ([2008](#ref-pesendorfer2008asymptotic))

### BBL: First Stage

First stage: estimate the policy functions (CCP) non-parametrically

-   Directly retrievable from data
    -   Entry decisions $\hat e (s_{i t}, s_{-i t})$
    -   Exit decisions $\hat d (s_{i t}, s_{-i t})$
    -   Investment decisions $\hat a (s_{i t}, s_{-i t})$
    -   Transition probabilities $\hat f (s_{i t}, s_{-i t} ; \theta^f)$
-   Conditional on having enough data
    -   **Note**: need to estimate choice probabilities, conditional on
        each state
    -   Problem with many states but especially with many players
        -   Curse of dimensionality
    -   Problem especially for transition probabilities: state $\times$
        state
-   Important to do it non-parametrically: parametric assumptions would
    contradict the model for the estimation of value/polify functions

### BBL: Second Stage

We now have the policy functions, CCPs and state transition
probabilities

-   We can use them together to simulate **histories**
-   If we have a candidate value of $\theta^\pi$, we can compute static
    payoffs
-   Simulated history + static payoffs = simualted value function
-   We can average over may simulated value functions to get an
    **expected value function**

What is the objective function?

-   Potentially many options
-   We want parameters that give firms the highest values, given those
    strategies (CCPs)

### In Practice

Take a parameter $\theta$.

For many simulations do:

-   Initialize firms value to zero
-   Fot $t=0 ... \infty$ do
    -   For each state do:
        -   For each firm do:
            -   Compute static profits
                $\pi(s_{i t}, s_{-i t} ; \theta^{\pi})$
            -   Compute firms actions using $\hat a (s_{i t}, s_{-i t})$
                and $\hat d (s_{i t}, s_{-i t})$
            -   If firm exits, $\hat d = 0$, end
            -   If not, $\hat d = 1$, subtract $a_{i,t}$ from profits
            -   Use $\hat f (s_{i t}, s_{-i t} ; \theta^f)$ to
                *simulate* next state for firm $i$
            -   Add discounted profits to the value function
                $\beta^t \pi(s_{i t}, s_{-i t} ; \theta^{\pi})$
        -   Use the next state, $(s_{i t+1}, s_{-i t+1})$ as current
            state for the next iteration

Then average all the value functions together to obtain an **expected
value function** $\mathbb E \Big[ V (s_{i t}, s_{-i t} ; \theta) \Big]$

-   **Note**: advantage of simulations: can be parallelized

### Objective Function

**Idea**

-   If the observed choices $\hat a (s_{i t}, s_{-i t})$ and
    $\hat d (s_{i t}, s_{-i t})$ are optimal,

    -   All other choices $\tilde a (s_{i t}, s_{-i t})$ and
        $\tilde d (s_{i t}, s_{-i t})$

    -   At the true parameters $\theta$

    -   Should give a lower expected value $$
        \mathbb E \Big[ \tilde V (s_{i t}, s_{-i t} ; \theta) \Big] \leq \mathbb E \Big[ V (s_{i t}, s_{-i t} ; \theta) \Big]
        $$

-   So which are the true parameters?

    -   Those for which any deviation from the policy yields a lowe
        value

    -   **Objective function**: minimize the violations $$
        \hat{\theta}= \arg \min_{\theta} \sum_{\left(s_{i t}, s_{-i t}\right)} \sum_{(\tilde{a}, \tilde{d})} \Bigg[\min \bigg\lbrace \mathbb E \Big[ \tilde V (s_{i t}, s_{-i t} ; \theta) \Big] - \mathbb E \Big[ V (s_{i t}, s_{-i t} ; \theta) \Big], 0 \bigg\rbrace \Bigg]^{2}
        $$

### Comments

**Objective function**: minimization of the violations for any other
policy $$
\hat{\theta}= \arg \min_{\theta} \sum_{\left(s_{i t}, s_{-i t}\right)} \sum_{(\tilde{a}, \tilde{d})} \Bigg[\min \bigg\lbrace \mathbb E \Big[ \tilde V (s_{i t}, s_{-i t} ; \theta) \Big] - \mathbb E \Big[ V (s_{i t}, s_{-i t} ; \theta) \Big], 0 \bigg\rbrace \Bigg]^{2}
$$

-   $\min \lbrace g(\cdot), 0 \rbrace$ to pick only the violations
    -   If inequality is respected, we can ignore
    -   Doesn’t matter by how much you respect the inequality
-   Which perturbation $\tilde a (s_{i t}, s_{-i t})$ and
    $\tilde d (s_{i t}, s_{-i t})$ ?
    -   In principle, any perturbation is ok
    -   But in practice, if we perturbe it too much, we can go too far
        off
    -   Tip 1: start with *very small perturbations*
    -   Tip 2: use perturbation that sensibly affect the dynamics
        -   E.g. exiting less in states with already low exit
            probability is probably irrelevant

### Problems

1.  Computational **curse of dimensionality** is gone (in the state
    space)
    -   But we have a curse of dimensionality in data
    -   Need a lot of markets because **now 1 market is 1 observation**
2.  **Multiple equilibria**??
    -   We are basically assuming it away
    -   Estimating the CCPs in the first stage we assume that is the
        equilibrium tht is played in all markets at all times
    -   To run counterfactuals, we still need to solve the model
3.  Unobserved heterogeneity
    -   Kasahara and Shimotsu ([2009](#ref-kasahara2009nonparametric)):
        how to identify the (minimum) number of unobserved types
    -   Arcidiacono and Miller
        ([2011](#ref-arcidiacono2011conditional)): how to use an EM
        algorithm for the 1st stage estimation with unobserved types,
        conditional on the number of types
    -   S. T. Berry and Compiani ([2021](#ref-berry2021empirical)):
        instrumental variables approach, relying on observed states in
        the distant past
4.  **Non-stationarity**
    -   If we have a long time period, something fundamentally might
        have changed

## Igami, Uetake (2019)

### Question

**Q**: *how much should an industry be allowed to consolidate?*

-   Normally analyzed statically
-   Static trade-offs
    -   Price effects
    -   Synergies (scale economies?)
-   However, mergers are not exogenous events
-   Dynamic trade-offs
    -   Demsetz ([1973](#ref-demsetz1973industry)): monopoly as a winner
        of an innovation race
    -   S. Berry and Pakes ([1993](#ref-berry1993some)): any dynamic
        benefit could offset static inefficiences
    -   Gilbert and Greene ([2014](#ref-gilbert2014merging)): FTC and
        DOJ always *try* to assess “impact on innovation”

### Dynamic Trade-offs

With mergers, entry and exit

-   Statically
    -   Price effects (-)
    -   Synergies (+)
-   Ex-post effects
    -   Regress mergers on competition (HHI)? 🙅🙅🙅
    -   Innovation: literature finds almost anything (+/-/invU/plateau)
-   Dynamic
    -   The potential for a merger can induce more ex-ante innovation
        and ex-ante entry

**This Paper**

-   **Model**: mergers, innovation, entry and exit in the HD industry
-   **Objective**: study optimal merger policy

### Empirical Issues

On the dynamics

-   Mergers are rare events $=$ no experiment $\to$ need a model
-   Dynamic games $=$ multiple equilibria $\to$ no “full solution”
-   Innovative industries $=$ global & nonstationary$\to$ no
    “2-step”estimation
    -   we have 1 market $\leftrightarrow$ 1 data point

**Solution**

-   Random moves
-   Like Rust

### Model

**State** $\omega_{it}$: productivity of firm $i$ at time $t$

**Actions**

-   Exit
    -   Get a scrap value $\kappa^e$
    -   Exit the industry
-   Idle
    -   No cost
    -   Productivity stays the same
-   Innovation
    -   Pay innovation cost $\kappa^i$
    -   Productivity increases stochastically:
        $\omega_{i,t+1} = \omega_{i,t+1} + 1$
-   Merger
    -   pay a merger cost $\kappa^m$
    -   Get the maximum productivity of both firms
        $\omega_{i,t+1} = \max \lbrace \omega_{it}, \omega_{jt} \rbrace$

### Timeline

Timing of moves, within a period

1.  Nature picks a mover $i$ uniformly at random
2.  Firm $i$ market a take-it-or-leave-it offer
3.  All active firms get payoffs $\pi_{it} (\omega_t)$
4.  State transitions realize from $\omega_t$ to $\omega_{t+1}$
    -   Stochastic Poisson synergy $\Delta{ijt}$
    -   You might jump up more than 1 level

Finite horizon $T (=2025)$!

**Equilibrium**

-   Unique sequential equilibrium
-   In practice, it’s a single agent problem
-   Can be solved by backward induction

### Motivating Evidence (1):

Expansion in the 80s followed by a lot of consolidation.

<img src="../img/8_01.png" style="width:50.0%" />

### Motivating Evidence (2)

Consolidation or exit?

-   In the 80/90s mostly exit
-   Then mergers

<img src="../img/8_02.png" style="width:90.0%" />

### Steps

-   Estimate **demand** $(\alpha_0, \alpha_1, \alpha_2)$
    -   Log-linear specification:
        $\log Q_{t}=\alpha_{0}+\alpha_{1} \log P_{t}+\alpha_{2} \log X_{t}+\varepsilon_{t}$
    -   IV $Z_t$: input cost, disk price
-   Compute marginal costs $mc_{it}$
    -   Cournot competition
    -   Invert the first-order condition and back out marginal costs:
        $mc_{it} = p_{it} + \frac{\partial p}{\partial q} q_{it}$
-   Estimate **sunk costs** $(\kappa^i, \kappa^m, \kappa^e)$
    -   Keane and Wolpin ([1997](#ref-keane1997career)) kind of routine
        -   Pick a parameter value
        -   Solve the game by backward induction
        -   Compute CCPs
        -   Compute likelihood
    -   Estimate parameter by maximum likelihood

### FAQ

-   **State space**?
    -   Marginal cost of firms
    -   As if in the first step we are estimating the state space
    -   Only in the second step we have the dynamics
-   How to deal with the **sequential moves**?
    -   Split the time frame into sufficiently granular time spans
    -   So that there is never 2 actions occurring at the same time
-   How to deal with **periods where nothing happens**?
    -   Could be that nobody moves
    -   Or some mergers are tried and failed
-   **Bargaining power**?
    -   Mergers ar erare events: sensitivity analysis

### Results (1): Model Fit

Model fits data reasonably well

<img src="../img/8_03.png" style="width:60.0%" />

### Results (2): Mergers and Innovation

What is the estimated **innovation** curve?

-   Plateau: increasing concave returns from innnovation in the number
    of (identical) firms

**Merger** incentives?

-   U-shaped: as concentration increases, outside option of merging
    parties increse

<img src="../img/8_04.png" style="width:90.0%" />

### Policy

What is the optimal number of firms? Definitely not 1.

<img src="../img/8_05.png" style="width:70.0%" />

## Igami, Sugaya (2021)

### Literature

-   Porter ([1983](#ref-porter1983study))
    -   Railroad cartel before the Sherman Act: legal
    -   Firms were keeping records of cartel activity
-   Green and Porter ([1984](#ref-green1984noncooperative))
    -   Theory: including demand uncertainty
-   Ellison ([1994](#ref-ellison1994theories))
    -   Why cartels break down at the top of the business cycle?
        -   You expect there to be a downturn in the future
        -   Low future continuation value
        -   Higher incentives to cheat
-   Asker ([2010](#ref-asker2010study))
    -   Bid rigging cartel of stamp dealers
-   Igami and Sugaya ([2021](#ref-igami2021measuring))
    -   Dynamic model of cartel survival

### Setting

**Problem** of cartel papers: **variation** in markets

-   Usually 1 cartel in 1 market $\to$ no variation for estimation

Vitamin cartel

-   one of the biggest cartels in history
-   affected a lot of different vitamins
-   each vitamin is a separate market
-   also, different cartels for different vitamins
    -   broke at different points in time (endogenously, no antitrust
        action)
    -   **research question**: why?
-   a lot of insider information on the cartels

### Research Question

Why did some cartels survive for a decade while others collapsed after
only a few years?

<img src="../img/8_06.png" style="width:60.0%" />

How do mergers affect the incentive to collude?

### Bernheim Report

-   [Bates White witness report
    (2002)](https://appliedantitrust.com/04_private_actions/damages/vitamin_c/vitamin_c_edny_bernheim_report11_14_2008.pdf)
-   On behalf of 4000+ vitamin buyers claiming damages from the cartel
-   Involved in jury trial and made public in 2003
-   Contains price and cost information for La Roche

<img src="../img/8_07.png" style="width:50.0%" />

### Vitamins

**Product**: vitamins

-   Geographically is a global market
-   But each vitamin constitute a separate market
-   Homogeneous good

**Demand**

-   General health benefits, but no clear scientific evidence (on
    humans)
-   Generally 9000+ purchasers of vitamins
    -   Who? Farmers, cooperatives, …. Coca cola has 2.14% marekt share

**Supply**

-   Market dominated by european big3: Roche, BASF, RP

### The Cartel (1): History

**History**

-   1989: price war
-   June 7 1989 in Basel, BASF and la Roche start talk
-   August 1989, Zurich: RP joins the talks

**Design**

-   For vitamins A and B
-   Foresee demand growth
-   Split it according to pre-1989 market shares
-   Quarterly meetings to monitor the cartel performance

**Cartel expansion**

-   1990 and 1991: added new members

### The Cartel (2): Structure

**Monitoring**: almost perfect

-   Self-reported sales data
-   They were using government trade statistics to verify self-reports
    -   Published with a time lag

**Punishment**

-   Threat of reversion to competitive prices
-   EC report (2003)
    -   Takeda was often not complying with the agreement
    -   “*the three European producers presented Takeda with an
        ultimatum unless it agreed to cut back its vitamin C sales, they
        would withdraw from the agreement*” (p. 44)

Other collusion-relevant info

-   No multi-market contact
-   No complicated punishment strategies, like carrot-stick
-   No proce wars as part of the equilibrium (a la Green and Porter
    ([1984](#ref-green1984noncooperative)))

### The Cartel (3): End

-   6 **natural deaths**
    -   Entry of foreign suppliers
-   10 forced terminations
    -   RP applied for Corporative Leniency Program
    -   One of the first major cartel cases to make use of this
        instrument
    -   Roche and BASF pleaded guilty
-   **Mergers**
    -   RP merged with Hoechst $\to$ Aventis (1998)
    -   BASF acquired Takeda (2001)

### Model

Demand: linear $$
Q_{t}^{D}=\alpha_{0}+\alpha_{1} P_{t}+\alpha_{2} X_{t}+\varepsilon_{t}
$$ Fringe supply

-   Preferred specification: constant fraction of total quantity:
    $Q_{t}^{D}=Q_{c a r, t}+Q_{f r i, t}$

Supply: Cournot. With **FOC** $$
P_{t}+\frac{d P}{d Q_{t}} \times q_{i, t}=c_{\text {roche }, t}^{\text {obs }}+\gamma_{i}+\eta_{i, t}
$$ Different **profit functions**

1.  Cartel: all collude
2.  Deviation: all collude a part for the deviator that best responds
3.  Competition: all best respond

### Estimation

GMM function with three moment conditions

-   Independence of demand shock and supply cost shifter $$
    \bar{m}_{1}(\theta)=\sum_{y} \bar{\varepsilon}_{y} \cdot Z_{y}
    $$

-   Independence of supply shock and demand shifter $$
    \bar{m}_{2, i}(\theta)=\sum_{y} \bar{\eta}_{i, y} \cdot W_{i, y}
    $$

-   Independence between controls and demand error term $$
    \bar{m}_{3}(\theta)=\sum_{t} \bar{\eta}_{t} \cdot X_{t}
    $$

### Incentive Compatibility (1)

Value of complying $$
V_{i, \tau \mid t}^{C}=\sum_{s \geq \tau} \beta^{s-\tau} \pi_{i, s \mid t}^{C}
$$ Value of not complying $$
V_{i, \tau \mid t}^{D}=\sum_{s=\tau}^{\tau+2} \beta^{s-\tau} \pi_{i, s \mid t}^{D}+\sum_{s \geq \tau+3} \beta^{s-\tau} \pi_{i, s \mid t}^{N}
$$ ICC $$
\min _{i \in I, \tau \geq t}\left(V_{i, \tau \mid t}^{C}-V_{i, \tau \mid t}^{D}\right) \geq 0
$$ How to **compute** it? We need expectation of

-   Future **market size**
-   Future size of the **supply fringe**

### Incentive Compatibility (2): Computation

**Demand**: market size

-   Assume perfect foresight
-   Also pretty stable

**Supply**: size of the supply fringe

-   Series of shocks in the 90s
    -   Bew method invented
    -   Bosnian war 1992-95
    -   Deng’s ’92 speech
-   All unforeseen shocks
-   Firms project current level of fringe output to the future

### Incentive Compatibility (2): Results

We can plot the firm incentives
$V_{i, \tau \mid t}^{C}-V_{i, \tau \mid t}^{D}$ for each firm.

As fringe enters the market, incentives drop.

### Counterfactuals (1)

Who killed the vitamin cartel? Explore different combinations of

1.  **Fringe** stopped growing after 1994
2.  **Demand** did not slow down because of the 1990’s shocks

<img src="../img/8_09.png" style="width:50.0%" />

### Counterfactuals (2)

Could the **BASF-Takeda** merger save the vitamin cartel?

-   What if they had done it before?
-   BASF gets the minimum marginal cost + some synergy
-   No capacity constraints
-   Same cartel quotas

<img src="../img/8_10.png" style="width:80.0%" />

**Remark**: too many synergies make the cartel more asymmetric $\to$
less sustainable

### Counterfactuals (3)

Which merger would have helped the most?

-   Simulate **Roche mergers** with different combinations of
    competittors

<img src="../img/8_11.png" style="width:90.0%" />

**Remark**: again, because of asymmetries, incentives do not
monotonically increase with HHI
