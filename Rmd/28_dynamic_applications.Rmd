## Igami, Uetake (2019)

### Question

**Q**:  *how much should an industry be allowed to consolidate?*

- Normally analyzed statically
- Static trade-offs
  - Price effects
  - Synergies (scale economies?)
- However, mergers are not exogenous events
- Dynamic trade-offs
  - @demsetz1973industry: monopoly as a winner of an innovation race
  - @berry1993some: any dynamic benefit could offset static inefficiences
  - @gilbert2014merging: FTC and DOJ always *try* to assess "impact on innovation"



### Dynamic Trade-offs

With mergers, entry and exit

- Statically
  - Price effects (-)
  - Synergies (+)
- Ex-post effects
  - Regress mergers on competition (HHI)? üôÖüôÖüôÖ
  - Innovation: literature finds almost anything (+/-/invU/plateau)
- Dynamic
  - The potential for a merger can induce more ex-ante innovation and ex-ante entry 

**This Paper**

- **Model**: mergers, innovation, entry and exit in the HD industry
- **Objective**: study optimal merger policy



### Empirical Issues

On the dynamics

- Mergers are rare events $=$ no experiment $\to$ need a model
- Dynamic games $=$ multiple equilibria $\to$ no "full solution"
- Innovative industries $=$ global & nonstationary$\to$ no ‚Äú2-step‚Äùestimation
  - we have 1 market $\leftrightarrow$ 1 data point

**Solution** 

- Random moves
- Like Rust



### Model

**State** $\omega_{it}$: productivity of firm $i$ at time $t$

**Actions**

- Exit
  - Get a scrap value $\kappa^e$
  - Exit the industry
- Idle
  - No cost
  - Productivity stays the same
- Innovation
  - Pay innovation cost $\kappa^i$
  - Productivity increases stochastically: $\omega_{i,t+1} = \omega_{i,t+1} + 1$
- Merger
  - pay a merger cost $\kappa^m$
  - Get the maximum productivity of both firms $\omega_{i,t+1} = \max \lbrace \omega_{it}, \omega_{jt} \rbrace$



### Timeline

Timing of moves, within a period

1. Nature picks a mover $i$ uniformly at random
2. Firm $i$ market a take-it-or-leave-it offer
3. All active firms get payoffs $\pi_{it} (\omega_t)$
4. State transitions realize from $\omega_t$ to $\omega_{t+1}$
   - Stochastic Poisson synergy $\Delta{ijt}$
   - You might jump up more than 1 level

Finite horizon $T (=2025)$!

**Equilibrium**

- Unique sequential equilibrium 
- In practice, it's a single agent problem
- Can be solved by backward induction



### Motivating Evidence (1): 

Expansion in the 80s followed by a lot of consolidation.

### Motivating Evidence (2)

Consolidation or exit?

- In the 80/90s mostly exit
- Then mergers

![](../img/8_02.png){width=90%}



### Steps

- Estimate **demand** $(\alpha_0, \alpha_1, \alpha_2)$
  - Log-linear specification: $\log Q_{t}=\alpha_{0}+\alpha_{1} \log P_{t}+\alpha_{2} \log X_{t}+\varepsilon_{t}$
  - IV $Z_t$: input cost, disk price
- Compute marginal costs $mc_{it}$
  - Cournot competition
  - Invert the first-order condition and back out marginal costs: $mc_{it} = p_{it} + \frac{\partial p}{\partial q} q_{it}$ 
- Estimate **sunk costs** $(\kappa^i, \kappa^m, \kappa^e)$
  - @keane1997career kind of routine
    - Pick a parameter value
    - Solve the game by backward induction
    - Compute CCPs
    - Compute likelihood
  - Estimate parameter by maximum likelihood



### FAQ

- **State space**?
  - Marginal cost of firms
  - As if in the first step we are estimating the state space
  - Only in the second step we have the dynamics
- How to deal with the **sequential moves**?
  - Split the time frame into sufficiently granular time spans
  - So that there is never 2 actions occurring at the same time
- How to deal with **periods where nothing happens**?
  - Could be that nobody moves
  - Or some mergers are tried and failed
- **Bargaining power**?
  - Mergers ar erare events: sensitivity analysis



### Results (1): Model Fit

Model fits data reasonably well

![](../img/8_03.png){width=60%}



### Results (2): Mergers and Innovation

What is the estimated **innovation** curve?

- Plateau: increasing concave returns from innnovation in the number of (identical) firms

**Merger** incentives?

- U-shaped: as concentration increases, outside option of merging parties increse

![](../img/8_04.png){width=90%}



### Policy

What is the optimal number of firms? Definitely not 1.

## Igami, Sugaya (2021)

### Literature

- @porter1983study
  - Railroad cartel before the Sherman Act: legal
  - Firms were keeping records of cartel activity
- @green1984noncooperative
  - Theory: including demand uncertainty
- @ellison1994theories
  - Why cartels break down at the top of the business cycle?
    - You expect there to be a downturn in the future 
    - Low future continuation value
    - Higher incentives to cheat
- @asker2010study
  - Bid rigging cartel of stamp dealers
- @igami2021measuring
  - Dynamic model of cartel survival



### Setting

**Problem** of cartel papers: **variation** in markets

- Usually 1 cartel in 1 market $\to$ no variation for estimation

Vitamin cartel

- one of the biggest cartels in history
- affected a lot of different vitamins
- each vitamin is a separate market
- also, different cartels for different vitamins
  - broke at different points in time (endogenously, no antitrust action)
  - **research question**: why?
- a lot of insider information on the cartels



### Research Question

Why did some cartels survive for a decade while others collapsed after only a few years?

![](../img/8_06.png){width=60%}



How do mergers affect the incentive to collude?



### Bernheim Report

- [Bates White witness report (2002)](https://appliedantitrust.com/04_private_actions/damages/vitamin_c/vitamin_c_edny_bernheim_report11_14_2008.pdf)
- On behalf of 4000+ vitamin buyers claiming damages from the cartel
- Involved in jury trial and made public in 2003
- Contains price and cost information for La Roche

![](../img/8_07.png){width=50%}



### Vitamins

**Product**: vitamins

- Geographically is a global market
- But each vitamin constitute a separate market
- Homogeneous good

**Demand**

- General health benefits, but no clear scientific evidence (on humans)
- Generally 9000+ purchasers of vitamins
  - Who? Farmers, cooperatives, .... Coca cola has 2.14% marekt share

**Supply**

- Market dominated by european big3: Roche, BASF, RP



### The Cartel (1): History 

**History**

- 1989: price war
- June 7 1989 in Basel, BASF and la Roche start talk
- August 1989, Zurich: RP joins the talks

**Design**

- For vitamins A and B
- Foresee demand growth
- Split it according to pre-1989  market shares
- Quarterly meetings to monitor the cartel performance

**Cartel expansion**

- 1990 and 1991: added new members



### The Cartel (2): Structure

**Monitoring**: almost perfect

- Self-reported sales data
- They were using government trade statistics to verify self-reports
  - Published with a time lag

**Punishment**

- Threat of reversion to competitive prices
- EC report (2003)
  - Takeda was often not complying with the agreement
  - ‚Äú*the three European producers presented Takeda with an ultimatum unless it agreed to cut back its vitamin C sales, they would withdraw from the agreement*‚Äù (p. 44)

Other collusion-relevant info

- No multi-market contact
- No complicated punishment strategies, like carrot-stick
- No proce wars as part of the equilibrium (a la @green1984noncooperative)



### The Cartel (3): End

- 6 **natural deaths**
  - Entry of foreign suppliers
- 10 forced terminations
  - RP applied for Corporative Leniency Program
  - One of the first major cartel cases to make use of this instrument
  - Roche and BASF pleaded guilty
- **Mergers**
  - RP merged with Hoechst $\to$ Aventis (1998)
  - BASF acquired Takeda (2001)



### Model

Demand: linear
$$
Q_{t}^{D}=\alpha_{0}+\alpha_{1} P_{t}+\alpha_{2} X_{t}+\varepsilon_{t}
$$
Fringe supply

- Preferred specification: constant fraction of total quantity: $Q_{t}^{D}=Q_{c a r, t}+Q_{f r i, t}$

Supply: Cournot. With **FOC**
$$
P_{t}+\frac{d P}{d Q_{t}} \times q_{i, t}=c_{\text {roche }, t}^{\text {obs }}+\gamma_{i}+\eta_{i, t}
$$
Different **profit functions** 

1. Cartel: all collude
2. Deviation: all collude a part for the deviator that best responds
3. Competition: all best respond



### Estimation

GMM function with three moment conditions

- Independence of demand shock and supply cost shifter
  $$
  \bar{m}_{1}(\theta)=\sum_{y} \bar{\varepsilon}_{y} \cdot Z_{y}
  $$
  
- Independence of supply shock and demand shifter
  $$
  \bar{m}_{2, i}(\theta)=\sum_{y} \bar{\eta}_{i, y} \cdot W_{i, y}
  $$
  
- Independence between controls and demand error term
  $$
  \bar{m}_{3}(\theta)=\sum_{t} \bar{\eta}_{t} \cdot X_{t}
  $$
  



### Incentive Compatibility (1)

Value of complying
$$
V_{i, \tau \mid t}^{C}=\sum_{s \geq \tau} \beta^{s-\tau} \pi_{i, s \mid t}^{C}
$$
Value of not complying
$$
V_{i, \tau \mid t}^{D}=\sum_{s=\tau}^{\tau+2} \beta^{s-\tau} \pi_{i, s \mid t}^{D}+\sum_{s \geq \tau+3} \beta^{s-\tau} \pi_{i, s \mid t}^{N}
$$
ICC
$$
\min _{i \in I, \tau \geq t}\left(V_{i, \tau \mid t}^{C}-V_{i, \tau \mid t}^{D}\right) \geq 0
$$
How to **compute** it? We need expectation of

- Future **market size**
- Future size of the **supply fringe**



### Incentive Compatibility (2): Computation

**Demand**: market size

- Assume perfect foresight
- Also pretty stable

**Supply**: size of the supply fringe

- Series of shocks in the 90s
  - Bew method invented
  - Bosnian war 1992-95
  - Deng's '92 speech
- All unforeseen shocks
- Firms project current level of fringe output to the future



### Incentive Compatibility (2): Results

We can plot the firm incentives $V_{i, \tau \mid t}^{C}-V_{i, \tau \mid t}^{D}$ for each firm.



![](../img/8_08.png){width=50%}



As fringe enters the market, incentives drop.



### Counterfactuals (1)

Who killed the vitamin cartel? Explore different combinations of

1. **Fringe** stopped growing after 1994 
2. **Demand** did not slow down because of the 1990's shocks

![](../img/8_09.png){width=50%}



### Counterfactuals (2)

Could the **BASF-Takeda** merger save the vitamin cartel?

- What if they had done it before?
- BASF gets the minimum marginal cost + some synergy
- No capacity constraints
- Same cartel quotas



![](../img/8_10.png){width=80%}



**Remark**: too many synergies make the cartel more asymmetric $\to$ less sustainable



### Counterfactuals (3)

Which merger would have helped the most?

- Simulate **Roche mergers** with different combinations of competittors



![](../img/8_11.png){width=90%}



**Remark**: again, because of asymmetries, incentives do not monotonically increase with HHI
