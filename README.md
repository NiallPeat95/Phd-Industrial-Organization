# Empirical Industrial Organization
In this repository, I collect the lecture notes and code for an advanced course in Empirical Industrial Organization. All code is written in Julia.

The goal of the class is to make Empirical Industrial Organization knowledge and tools available to everyone. Therefore, I will devote most of the focus on the logic behind theory and on the connection between theory and practical implementation. This is also the reason why I decided to make the lecture notes and code publicly available on Github and picked Julia as a programming language. Julia has the advantage of being extremely readable for what concerns algebra, while being faster than Matlab and, most importantly, free.
